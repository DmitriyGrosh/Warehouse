# Description

This is test project to test my skills, you can see app for warehouses.
In this app you can remove, delete, create products in you warehouses also you can create and delete warehouses.
You have 2 types of warehouses: unallocated and default. And you have Products which you can move betwen your warehouses.

I think this project need to watch for how I can use react/redux. I know about architecture problems with redux, and in future i will remake, this but now you can see what i have done for 3-4 work days 
it is not very good project, but i can work better. So it was nice challange

Thanks
